      <h2>
        <p>
          I had a meaningful phrase here, originally, that was supposed to be a poetic
          puzzle to explain my essential nature.  That was boring.  And it wasn't
          right.  While it reflected a part of my personality, it was distant and cold.
          I am more likely to be associated with 'approachable' than 'distant.'

          Your musical challenge, should you accept, is to learn what qualities or beliefs
          might be represented by each of the following lines of They Might Be Giants song lyrics.
        </p>

        Isn't that better than a stuffy piece of poetry?

      <h3>
        <p>Spider!  He is our hero! (okay, I just really like this song)</p>
        <p>Which describes how you're feeling all the time</p>
        <p>I want to raise my freak flag higher</p>
        <p>She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me</p>
        <p>Put a little birdhouse in your soul</p>
        <p>I should be allowed to think</p>
        <p>How can I sing like a girl</p>
        <p>Putting all reason aside, you exchange what you've got for a thing that's hypnotic and strange</p>
        <p>I am not your broom</p>
        <p>I was a snowball in hell</p>
        <p>Use your eyes to look up, use your ears to hear</p>
