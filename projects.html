    <p>
      This is a tool for a User to track incidents where s/he felt included or excluded.
      It is a Django project project written in Python (3.5) using a PostGreSQL database
      with jQuery, Javascript, HTML5 and Twitter's Bootstrap on the frontend.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of July 25, I discovered that the tutorial I followed (mea culpa - I did not use
      the Heroku tutorial), while very simple and straight-forward, did not have any
      data or static files to import.  Because it is important to me to have a viewable
      sample of the project available, even if incompletely deployed, I have updated my
      site and invite you to use it.  I am still learning, and I know that.  I learned so
      much in deployment that I was not taught specifically in my class and I learned
      it in a short span of time.  For example, now I know to relocate the SECRET_KEY
      in my settings.py module before it is every committed to Git.  I knew that I
      didn't want to deploy any personal passwords, but had not known/thought about
      the passwords created by the project initialization.  Lesson learned and remembered!
      I also learned how to add passwords to the os environment.  I also finally built
      the script that will auto-load descriptors and persons for anyone who clones the
      repo to use for themselves.  I am working on learning the static file import, but
      manually entered enough data on Heroku to give a sense of how it works.
    </p>
    <p>
      To view the pages, a login is required.  The user is "fidelma" as in Sister Fidelma
      of Kildare.  The password you need is "tremayne", the last name of Fidelma's
      author/creator, Peter Tremayne.

      Python game.  The assignment was to write 3 different styles of Tic-Tac-Toe boards.  I
      did not finish in the time alotted and have not gone back to finish.  I included this
      here because it was the one assignment which included writing a
